90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a partial digital text of
    al-Bulqīnī's Maḥāsin al-Iṣṭilāḥ, a commentary on Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's
    Muqaddima. In the print edition, Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text was printed
    at the top of the page, and al-Bulqīnī's at the bottom.
    Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text contains 65 anwāʿ,
    and at the end of the text, al-Bulqīnī adds four additional anwāʿ.
    The digital text contains only Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text
    and al-Bulqīnī's four additional anwāʿ, not al-Bulqīnī's
    comments to Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text.
    PV split off al-Bulqīnī's additional anwāʿ.
    All paratextual elements
