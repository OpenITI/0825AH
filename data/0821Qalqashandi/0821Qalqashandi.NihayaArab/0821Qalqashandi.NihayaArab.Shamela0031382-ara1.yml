90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Tribal groups had been numbered, but there are no
     numbers in the edition, so I have deleted these and instead marked each
     tribal group with a fourth-level header. There is a title missing for p.
     118. Some tribal names and categories are misspelt. Lines 8073-8092
     (page V01P349) have no actual correspondence to the pdf, not sure what
     happened here.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Titles that were tagged incompletely corrected. Untagged headers tagged. Levelling of the headers corrected. A few blank headers added to show the change of alphabetical order of titles. A few pages collected by the publisher and a duplicate page at the end of the text removed. The missing title in page 118 reported by the annotator typed. 2- The text in PageV01P349 moved to its correct place (i.e. the last page of the text). Now, this page is missing. 3- A different edition of the text is accessible here: https://archive.org/details/olomnasb_ymail_20170812_0036
