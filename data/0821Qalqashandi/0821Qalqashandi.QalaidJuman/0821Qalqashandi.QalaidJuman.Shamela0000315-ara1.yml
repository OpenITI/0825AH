90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The digital edition is effectively incomplete: it is
        missing the last major section (khatima) pp. 179-206 in the edition.
        Work has further substructure than I have marked, but many of those
        units would only be a few lines so I have stopped at fifth level
        headers. The structure is often clearer when reading the text as opposed
        to the section headers in the edition which are not very consistent.
       NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Titles that were tagged incompletely corrected. Another layer of tags (sixth-level headers) added. 2- The khatima section reported by the annotator as missing is actually not a part of the original text. It is written after the death of Qalqashandi, probably by one of the agents in the court or library of the dedicatee of the book (this is just my guess based on the title of this section. One should read the introduction to understand this). So, this part is not a missing section. Of course, we can find its digital version and add it as a separate text to the repository.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
