90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Tribal groups had been numbered, but there are no
    numbers in the edition, so I have deleted these and instead marked each
    tribal group with a fourth-level header. There is a title missing for p.
    118. Some tribal names and categories are misspelt. Lines 8073-8092
    (page V01P349) have no actual correspondence to the pdf, not sure what
    happened here.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Titles that were tagged incompletely corrected.
    Untagged headers tagged. Levelling of the headers corrected. A few blank headers
    added to show the change of alphabetical order of titles. A few pages collected
    by the publisher and a duplicate page at the end of the text removed. The
    missing title in page 118 reported by the annotator typed. 2- The text in
    PageV01P349 moved to its correct place (i.e. the last page of the text). Now,
    this page is missing. 3- A different edition of the text is accessible here:
    https://archive.org/details/olomnasb_ymail_20170812_0036
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
