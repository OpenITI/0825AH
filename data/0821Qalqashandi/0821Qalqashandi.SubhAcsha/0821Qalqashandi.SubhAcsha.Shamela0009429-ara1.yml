90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I could not find a pdf of the edition (nor of the JK version
    which is based on another print), so I have primarily annotated based on the
    internal logic of the text which is exceptionally well signposted and on the
    editio princeps (see collated and link above, though I used it only sparingly).
    It seems that all later editions are based on the editio princeps.
 The hierarchy goes to well beyond the five headers mARkdown allows (up to 15,
    if I'm not mistaken). Keeping track of this hierarchy is sometimes challenging,
    so I may have missed some.
 In vol. 1 there is a table of contents which is part of the original text, it
    was tagged as [المقدمة] but that isn't really appropriate, so I changed this
    into '[Table of contents]'.
 From PageV03P056 onwards there are calligraphic examples in the edition, these
    have not been rendered in the digital version and are marked by "؟؟؟" - this may
    need to be addressed in the future.
 There are various editorial sections throughout the work, usually at the end of
    volumes.
 The header on the top of PageV04P074 ("second fasl of second maqala") is a
    weird case, it doesn't work in the numbering and general structure of the work,
    which normally follows the structure maqala-bab-fasl, so here the bab is skipped
    and the first fasl has not been signposted. I have left it as is and tagged it
    as third level header. There are a few other cases where the typical maqala-bab-
    fasl structure is not followed perfectly and where a level that should be bab is
    in fact denoted as fasl. There are also some places where more subdivisions are
    announced than are effectively there. I have not clarified these, as it would
    require close reading and may be down to issues of textual transmission.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 1475, 84252,
    112854, 126830, 127958, 164416, 164434, 164445, 164457, 164474, 164481, 164484,
    164551, 164572, 164589, 164699, 164712, 164721, 164729, 164765
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 70, 72, 363
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Changes in the levelling of the headers made. Titles that were tagged incompletely corrected. EDITORIAL removed. PARATEXT added. 2- This link is exactly the same edition, but leads you to a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the PDF: https://noorlib.ir/book/view/2541?viewType=pdf
