90#VERS#COMMENT##: I could not find a pdf of the edition (nor of the JK version which is based on another print), so I have primarily annotated based on the internal logic of the text which is exceptionally well signposted and on the editio princeps (see collated and link above, though I used it only sparingly). It seems that all later editions are based on the editio princeps. 
 The hierarchy goes to well beyond the five headers mARkdown allows (up to 15, if I'm not mistaken). Keeping track of this hierarchy is sometimes challenging, so I may have missed some. 
 In vol. 1 there is a table of contents which is part of the original text, it was tagged as [المقدمة] but that isn't really appropriate, so I changed this into '[Table of contents]'. 
 From PageV03P056 onwards there are calligraphic examples in the edition, these have not been rendered in the digital version and are marked by "؟؟؟" - this may need to be addressed in the future.
 There are various editorial sections throughout the work, usually at the end of volumes.
 The header on the top of PageV04P074 ("second fasl of second maqala") is a weird case, it doesn't work in the numbering and general structure of the work, which normally follows the structure maqala-bab-fasl, so here the bab is skipped and the first fasl has not been signposted. I have left it as is and tagged it as third level header. There are a few other cases where the typical maqala-bab-fasl structure is not followed perfectly and where a level that should be bab is in fact denoted as fasl. There are also some places where more subdivisions are announced than are effectively there. I have not clarified these, as it would require close reading and may be down to issues of textual transmission.
