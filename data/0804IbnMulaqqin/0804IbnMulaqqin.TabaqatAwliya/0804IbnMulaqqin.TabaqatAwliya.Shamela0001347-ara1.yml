90#VERS#COMMENT##: Numbers are missing from biographical entries.
    Occasional minor scribal errors, otherwise closely matches printed
    edition. Some of the entries are not in alphabetical order, but this is
    the same in the printed edition. The printed edition includes several
    appendices (dhuyul); I am not sure if these need to be removed, so this
    should be checked. From pp. 327.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
