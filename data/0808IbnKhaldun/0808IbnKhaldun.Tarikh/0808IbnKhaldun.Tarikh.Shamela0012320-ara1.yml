90#VERS#COMMENT##: The permalinks are to the 1st edition (1981) - I
        could not find the 3rd edition (1988). Text is very stable and closely
        resembles the printed edition. No obvious errors.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. Corrected the headers that were
        not aligned in one line. I corrected the levelling of the headers as far as I
        could. More improvement is definitely possible (especially in volumes 3-5) if a
        specialist read the text closely. However, this is not easy at all since many of
        the subject matters related to the dynasties and events do not have clear
        borders, and the author seems to jump between subjects and return to them again.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
